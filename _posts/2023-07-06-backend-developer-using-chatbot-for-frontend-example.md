*Thank you, Mr ChatGPT*

*Q represents my question, and the quoted text is the response from ChatGPT.*

**Q: Does the `response` object in axios include the request URL context? For example, I want to determine the request URL and automatically set `keepToastOpen` to `true` if the path contains "price_break_discount". Here's the code snippet: (I pasted the relevant business code)**

> In the `response` object of axios, there is no direct context information about the request URL. However, you can determine the request URL using alternative methods and set the `keepToastOpen` parameter accordingly.
>
> One possible solution is to use the request interceptor of axios to check the URL before sending the request. You can set a custom request parameter to indicate whether to set `keepToastOpen` to `true`. Then, in the response interceptor, you can check this custom parameter and perform the necessary actions accordingly.
>
> Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to achieve this using request and response interceptors:
>
> ```javascript
> // Request interceptor
> axios.interceptors.request.use(config => {
>   if (config.url.includes('price_break_discount')) {
>     config.params = {
>       ...config.params,
>       keepToastOpen: true
>     };
>   }
>   return config;
> }, error => {
>   return Promise.reject(error);
> });
> 
> // Response interceptor
> axios.interceptors.response.use(response => {
>   if (response.config.params && response.config.params.keepToastOpen) {
>     // Perform the necessary actions based on the URL condition
>     // Call httpErrorHandler or other required logic here
>   }
>   return response;
> }, error => {
>   return Promise.reject(error);
> });
> ```

> In the above code, we use the request interceptor to check if the URL includes `'price_break_discount'`. If it does, we set `keepToastOpen` to `true`. Then, in the response interceptor, we check for this parameter and perform the corresponding actions.

**Q: However, I'm handling it within the error. Is there a way to access the `response` context within the response itself? If I directly write `httpErrorHandler(error.response.data.message, response.config.params.keepToastOpen)` within the error handling code, it throws an error saying `response` is undefined. Here's the code snippet: (I pasted the relevant business code)**

> In the error handling function, you cannot directly access the response object (`response`). However, you can retrieve the request configuration information, including the `params` parameter, from the `error` object's `config` property. You can then pass `response.config.params.keepToastOpen` as the third argument to the `httpErrorHandler` function.

>
> ```javascript
> const keepToastOpen = error.config.params && error.config.params.keepToastOpen;
> httpErrorHandler(error.response.data.message, keepToastOpen);
> ```
>
> In the above code, we use `error.config.params.keepToastOpen` to retrieve the `keepToastOpen` parameter from the request configuration, and then pass it as the third argument to the `httpErrorHandler` function.
